# RIIR
why not Rewrite It In Rust (**RIIR**)

Are you an author or contributor to a software project?

Have you ever been asked to rewrite, or consider rewriting that project in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)?

If so, you may have been a victim of the RIIR agenda that is sweeping the web.

If this has happened to you, please [report it](https://github.com/ansuz/RIIR/issues/) so that something can be done.


## FAQ

### R U SRS?

No. This is a joke.

### Y U HATE RUST SO MUCH?

I don't, actually. I believe that those who spend their time asking people to rewrite their projects are probably not themselves active Rust developers, as those active devs are probably busy [writing memory-safe code](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11331).
